Contians Colored Petri Nets (CPN) models discussed in the following two papers:

V. Gehlot and C. Nigro, “Colored Petri Net model of the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP),” Proc. IECON 2010 - 36th Annual Conference on IEEE Industrial Electronics Society, pp. 2150-2155, 7-10 Nov. 2010.

Abstract 1: Presence information is one of the key aspects of mobile computing. Depending on the type of presence information,
a variety of services can be built on top of a basic presence architecture. These can range from simple notification
services and context-aware computing to more complex dynamic discovery and load balancing in mobile environments
such as airborne web services (AWS). This paper gives details of a validated presence architecture based on the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP). Although SIP is viewed as an internet telephony protocol, in reality SIP applications
go much beyond basic telephone services. This makes a SIP based Presence architecture even more attractive. By using
the modular and hierarchy mechanism of our adopted modeling approach, other services and applications for mobile
computations that make use of presence can be easily built on the top of the presented model and analyzed.

Abstract 2: The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) together with its extension for presence and messaging is considered to be an
enabler of converged communications. At the core, SIP is a signaling protocol used for establishing sessions in an IP
network. SIP has been adopted by 3GPP for multimedia streaming services in cellular networks. This paper presents a
formalized and executable Colored Petri Net model of SIP and its components. Since the broader impact of SIP is the
realization of SIP-based services, these models can be used to design and analyze such services for desired behaviors prior to
implementation.
