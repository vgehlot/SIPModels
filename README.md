Abstract

Presence information is one of the key aspects of mobile computing. Depending on the type of presence information,
a variety of services can be built on top of a basic presence architecture. These can range from simple notification
services and context-aware computing to more complex dynamic discovery and load balancing in mobile environments
such as airborne web services (AWS). This paper gives details of a validated presence architecture based on the Session
Initiation Protocol (SIP). Although SIP is viewed as an internet telephony protocol, in reality SIP applications
go much beyond basic telephone services. This makes a SIP based Presence architecture even more attractive. By using
the modular and hierarchy mechanism of our adopted modeling approach, other services and applications for mobile
computations that make use of presence can be easily built on the top of the presented model and analyzed.
